## About Me

I'm a data-driven Business Analyst with a passion for simplifying complex data and transforming it into actionable insights. With a background in finance and an MBA in Business Analysis from Georgia State University, I've blended business strategy with data science to drive impact across analytics, underwriting, and automation.

Whether I'm building regression models in RapidMiner, cleaning cafÃ© sales in SQL, or visualizing KPIs in Tableau, I bring clarity, structure, and impact to every dataset.
